# hassleFreePr
********************************
### Description
hasselFreePr is a GitHub application built to optimize issue and pull request workflows using AI. It helps identify duplicate issues, close related issues automatically, and suggest relevant metadata like labels and projects.

#### Features
- Duplicate issue detection - When new issues are opened, hasselFreePr checks for similarities against existing issues using vector similarity search on a Supabase database. Highly similar issues are flagged as potential duplicates.
<br><br>
- Automatic issue closing - When pull requests are opened, hasselFreePr cross-references with open issues to determine if any should be automatically closed. This helps keep issue trackers clean and up-to-date.
<br><br>
- Metadata suggestions - Using natural language processing capabilities from LangChain and OpenAI's ChatGPT API, hasselFreePr suggests relevant labels, projects, and other metadata on new issues and pull requests.

#### Technical Details

- Issues and pull requests are synced to a Supabase PostgreSQL database and indexed in a vector search column using vector embedding models.
- New issues and PRs are encoded into vectors and compared against existing items using cosine similarity. Highly similar items are flagged.
- Metadata suggestions are generated by querying ChatGPT with the issue title, description, and other context.
- LangChain is used to parse ChatGPT responses into actionable suggestions.
- GitHub API is used for syncing data and automatically commenting/closing issues when applicable.
